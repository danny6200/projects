        <h2>#ABOUT ME</h2>
        <article id="me">
            <p>I'm Daniel Okoro but preferred to be addressed as Danny. I'm a frontend engineer who works conveniently with HTML, CSS, and JS web technologies.</p>
            
            <p>I'm passionate about building software products which proffer solutions to problems in any domain. I started writing algorithms from quite a young age (can't really remember the exact age) and coding from my part two in the university.</p>

        <h2>#EDUCATION</h2>
        <article>
            <p>I finished as the second best in my department - the department of Electrical/Electronic Engineering - with a Cummulative Grade Point Average(CGPA) of 6.5 out of 7.0 from the University of Ibadan.</p>

            <p>While in UI, I was exposed to Fortran programming in part two, python programming in part three and C programming in part four. This exposure further heightened my desire to work in the tech industry.</p>

        <h2>PORTFOLIO</h2>
        <p>This section contains some of the projects I have worked on and those I'm currently working on. It also showed the details of the technology stack used in the individual projects.</p>

        <details>
            <summary>To-Do List App</summary>
            <p>This app was built using HTML, vanila CSS and JS. The Project was used to display the power and simplicity of Jquery library over the DOM approach. It is an app used to log in one's schedule or task. It has the functionality of striking through a completed todo. It also provide the feature of deleting the task when it is not needed anymore. </p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>Color-Game App</summary>
            <p>This app was built using HTML, vanila CSS and JS. It is a game that randomly creates 6 different square colors while providing an rgb color in text. The player is expected to guess the square color that matches the rgb color code displayed. A correct guess makes all squares assume the rgb color code. A wrong guess keeps the player guessing while fading out the squares of wrong color match chosen by the player.  </p>
